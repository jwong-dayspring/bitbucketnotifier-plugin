Bitbucket Build Notifier Plugin for Jenkins
=======================================

This Jenkins plugin notifies Bitbucket of build results. Failed or
successful builds will show up as little icons in the Bitbucket web
interface in commit logs. Clicking on such an icon will take the
user to the specific build.

Inspired by and shamelessly borrowing code from Stash Build Notifier Plugin for Jenkins by Georg Gruetter and Pavel Batanov (https://github.com/jenkinsci/stashnotifier-plugin)
